## Project Summary
This project aims to establish a foundation for a smart IoT environment by using an FPGA Basys3 board to implement a digital clock with various functions and enable communication with a PC via UART.

### Key Features
- **Digital Clock** : Includes clock, stopwatch, and timer functions.

- **Sensor Integration** : Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor and temperature/humidity using a DHT11 sensor.

- **Data Communication** : Verifies information through UART communication with a PC and implements a stable data transfer technique using a FIFO buffer.

### Development Environment
- **FPGA Board** : Development was conducted using an FPGA board with Vivado.
